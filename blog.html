        <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

        <p>In my pursuit to better understand JavaScript underthehood‚Ñ¢ I've seen it been mentioned that there are
          obscure differences between methods and arrow functions on Classes e.g. <code>handleClick() {}</code> vs.
          <code>handleClick: () => {}</code>. I'd like to learn more about the potential pitfalls.
        </p>

        <p>What are the tradeoffs when I use arrow functions? When should I bind <code>this</code>? When should I
          <code>call(this)</code> What are some alternatives?
        </p>

        <p><strong>Let's get some basics out of the way</strong></p>

        <p>Wait..what's a class <em>field</em> again? *GPT-ing* Ok, it's basically a <em>property</em> that can
          either be private or public; private fields are prefixed by a <code>#</code>. When naming fields there are two
          that are off-limits: prototype and constructor. Duh.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Point #1</strong></p>
        <p><del>If you create a method using an arrow function, there is no way to override the method if you plan to
            <em>extend</em> the class. <code>this</code> only exists once super() is called which needs to be called
            immediately
            after the constructor is declared. It means any method overrides with the same name will only be scoped
            locally. NOT the <code>this</code> of the parent class.</del>
        </p>
        <p><del>When extending a Class, the required super() already has a context <code>this</code>. Creating a method
            using an arrow function in the extended child instance cannot alter the previously defined method on the
            parent.</del>
        </p>
        <p>Ok, I give up trying to understand/explain this in my own words. Here's the GPT explanation:</p>
        <blockquote>
          Why This Happens:

          To understand why this happens, we need to look at how class fields are de-sugared (translated) into
          traditional JavaScript code that uses prototypes behind the scenes.

          When you define a class field in a class, such as Counter, the actual method becomes a property of the
          instance created from that class. In the case of DoubledCounter extending Counter, the method from the parent
          class is already attached to the instance before the super() call in the subclass's constructor is executed.
          This means that when you try to override the method in the subclass, you're actually creating a new method
          that gets assigned after the initial parent method is already attached.
        </blockquote>
        <p>I was still a bit unclear as to why redefining a method doesn't override the parent's method
          <em>regardless</em> of definition order. Does that mean subclass methods with matching parent class
          methods can never be overridden?
        </p>

        <p><strong>Point #2</strong></p>
        <p>There are a few ways to get the expected behavior:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stick to the old way handler.bind(this)
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut out all the sugar and define your method on the <code>prototype</code>
          </li>
          <li>Via accessor <code>get</code></li>
          <li>Double arrow functions?? This is getting too complicated</li>
          <li>Last but not least: handleEvent()* This will be the focus of my next post as I'll hopefully be using it
            extensively in future projects</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Cool bits</strong></p>
        <p>I learned what a class field is and better yet I learned it can be
          <strong>computed.</strong><code>[`${taco}`] = 'suadero'</code>
        </p>
        <p>I don't think I answered my original questions that motivated me to read this article in the first place.
          Though, I'm glad I decided to start writing again.</p>
